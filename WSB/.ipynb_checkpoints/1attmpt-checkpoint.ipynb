The link number in the post corresponds with the link in this post. Here is that post:\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/HomeDepotHank69/comments/lwhwiw/links\\\\_for\\\\_gme\\\\_dd\\\\_compilation/](https://www.reddit.com/user/HomeDepotHank69/comments/lwhwiw/links_for_gme_dd_compilation/)\\n\\n**THE ACTUAL POST:**\\n\\nI’m sure many of you apes are in the same situation as me: smooth brain, ADHD meds, and wife’s boyfriend constantly forcing me to refresh the DD page when I could/should be masturbating to cuck porn. To help with this problem, I have made a compilation of all of the DD for GME that I could find. This is by no means complete, so please add more links in the comments. ENJOY.\\n\\n**First post:** Here’s a link to the first DD that I did on GME, I still stand by everything I said in that. This covers prevois price action, volume, brokerages, etc: \\n\\n**SEE LINK 1**\\n\\n**ETFs:** Hedge funds are massively shorting ETFs that contain GME or have a bearish sentiment in order to hide their positions, drive down the price, delay the squeeze, and make interest in GME decrease. Here are the links: \\n\\n**SEE LINK 2**\\n\\n**Borrow Rate:** Use this link from iborrowdesk to see that the available short shares of GME are behaving similarly to last time and that the borrow rate is hiking. Similar data can be found on fintel, but this site gives you more data: \\n\\n**SEE LINK 3**\\n\\n**Short interest:** As I said, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get an accurate short interest number because the numbers are probably not being accurately reported, naked shorts, and ETFs leading to indirect shorting. Here are a bunch of posts on all that shit: \\n\\n**SEE LINK 4**\\n\\n**Price action:** GME fractal pattern is repeating itself, which suggests that HFs keep trying to make it go down but it is resisting at every turn and is continuing to be bullish. My original post also has some information on price action.\\n\\n**SEE LINK 5**\\n\\n**Volume:** This is a great picture from someone on reddit, which shows how strangely similar volume and short interest are from January\\'s squeeze to now. \\n\\n**SEE VOLUME PICTURE 1**\\n\\n**Uncle Bruce:** Boomer who makes YouTube videos but is actually a smooth brain warrior with excellent insights about how some HFs are probably playing this long, which will only increase the price: \\n\\n**SEE LINK 6**\\n\\n**VIX:** GME price spikes seem to be correlated with more volatility in the market as the VIX usually spikes and SPX drops precipitously (note that if you think buying calls on the VIX is a good idea because of this, I would think twice because this squeeze will likely take longer and theta decay will eat your ass on VIX calls in the process): \\n\\n**SEE LINK 7**\\n\\nu/HeyItsPixeL: If you click on any of these links, click on this one. This is by far the best DD that I’ve ever seen on WSB. In short, he talks about the likelihood of a gamma/short squeeze all pointing to a specific date (March 19) because of naked shorts and provides a MASSIVE amount of data for it: \\n\\n**SEE LINK 8**\\n\\n**Catalysts and personal notes:** I echo everything that u/heyitspixel said in the above link. I also want to emphasize other potential catalysts such as earnings on March 26, possible acquisitions, AMC earnings tonight, Ryan Cohen tweets, DFV’s 500 april ITM calls, and Elon/Chamath/other celebrities tweeting about more interest in the stock. I cannot stress enough that I think this squeeze will take longer than the last one but will be bigger especially if us smooth brains continue to hold and buy. Right now, it seems that the HFs are building an extremely steep house of cards because of naked shorts that will eventually come tumbling down in an even bigger way than last time. They are trying to delay the squeeze so that people get bored and sell but all that it’s doing is building up the gas for the inevitable squeeze. I want to emphasize further than brokerages WILL be the end of this like they were last time, but I believe that because they have more liquidity and don’t want another media nightmare like last time, that they will let this last much longer. I also want to emphasize that their actions only have power if people actually do sell when they restrict buying. Finally, I want to emphasize heyitspixels sentiment that many other institutions seem to be long on this and want to profit from the squeeze as well, which only helps us. Right now, it seems like it’s WSB + some institution(s) v. HFs (Melvin, citadel, etc). Great posts about catalysts and future action: \\n\\n**SEE LINK 9**\\n\\n**Finally, I want to address 2 common arguments that I keep seeing:**\\n\\n1. “the squeeze is already squoze, this information is public, it’s not gonna happen again” – to that I say, take a look at any post before the January squeeze and you will see the exact same shit. Based on the information I’ve provided above, it’s hard to deny that another squeeze is not imminent, but if you wanna miss out, your brain is smoother than mine.\\n2. “No way hedge funds will let this happen again, they learned from last time” – to which I say, 2007 has entered the chat. If you really think that these guys learn from massive mistakes, your brain is smoother than silk. Most of these fuckers who are short are shorting out of rage and spite, which is making them act illogical. The fact that there is still AT LEAST 60% short interest on this after that massive squeeze shows that most of them didn’t cover and want to dig this thing into the ground. Don’t be naïve.\\n\\n**Date:** I don\\'t like when people give date predictions with no data, so I will be giving a range: March 17th - 31st. I say this because March 17th is 2 days before heyitspixel\\'s prediction about the quadruple witching day on March 19th. March 25th is after hours earnings. I\\'m saying that it could happen at any time in this range because of the T-3 rule for exercising deliveries (because March 26th is a Friday, we might not see the full action until sometime that next week). There could be giant run ups before these dates, but if there are, they are not the full squeeze as I believe that the volume on and after earnings will be the highest, which will be the perfect time for the squeeze. In short, stay strong throughout this entire month. \\n\\n**Conclusion:** (This is from my first post). Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can\\'t emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be and the date of March 19. Be strong apes, don\\'t get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong. Yes, RKT and AMC look nice rn, but GME will be soooooooooo much bigger, so the potential gains for holding GME compared to AMC/RKT are not even comparable (I like those stocks, but I like GME infinitely more).\\n\\n\"There’s some shady stuff going down.

Postmaster general DeFuck did. As a fuck you and knowing he’s on his way out seeing as he’s a Trump plant, he awarded your old baby clothes the NGDV contract. A company that didn’t even put forth a fully EV vehicle (more on this later). Did WKHS sell the fuck off right after the contract was announced? No doubt. Did I sell? Yes, but I’m back in with even more than I started seeing as I sold well before the bottom. Let me learn you a thing or two about why. \\n\\nWhen DeFuck made his decision, Dems flipped the fuck out. His decision went against the wishes of Biden and the Dems to electrify the federal fleet and start meeting carbon emission reduction goals. Plenty of reps including Tim Ryan from Ohio are insisting this contract award be revisited and reconsidered. This isn’t a fight they’re gonna give up on. WKHS has promised to challenge this decision and I’m sure if this stands many eco hippies are gonna lose their shit. What sounds impossible in reversing it isn’t that much of an impossibility at all. Enough about this contract though. \\n\\nLike I said in my previous DD, this company is so much more than this shitty government’s potential post office truck. They have potential suitors in IKEA, who are currently testing a fleet and aim to go all electric by 2025. They are focusing on researching and developing refrigerated vehicles. Once companies like Walmart and other similar companies start to look for electric grocery delivery vehicles, if WKHS captures this market its a big boost not only to the companies bottom line but to shareholders as well. \\n\\nTheir horsefly drone is the real tech of the company though. Currently being tested by the UPS and patents pending for vehicle launched delivery drones, this is where I see the real growth and future of the company and I believe Mama Cathie sees as well. She doesn’t own over $45m worth of shares betting on a fucking contract, especially a government one. If they perfect this system, allowing for efficient and safe package delivery, and can manage a whole fleet with one single easy to use app they’re gonna boom. \\n\\nInstitutions continue to BTFD and the company is up to 54% institutional ownership including big boys like Blackrock, Vanguard, Citi, ARK. There’s growth here, whales see it, and whales are buying it all the fucking time. \\n\\nThey missed on revenue yesterday but that’s expected when 30% of their workforce was out with Covid for a time. Their EPS beat by a surprise $2,678% so...\\n\\nLastly, this company is a perfect candidate for a buyout and there’s chatter of a TSLA scoop up of WKHS. The EV world is increasingly becoming saturated with companies and they can’t all survive. Smaller ones can easily be bought by the big boys to try and ease this saturation and compete with one another. \\n\\nIt’s found it’s floor IMO and the only way is up from here IMO but I’m a degenerate who thought the government could do something right for once. \\n\\nThis isn’t financial advice I just love the damn stock.

Postmaster general DeCuck did. As a fuck you and knowing he’s on his way out seeing as he’s a Trump plant, he awarded your old baby clothes the NGDV contract. A company that didn’t even put forth a fully EV vehicle (more on this later). Did WKHS sell the fuck off right after the contract was announced? No doubt. Did I sell? Yes, but I’m back in with even more than I started seeing as I sold well before the bottom. Let me learn you a thing or two about why. \\n\\nWhen DeCuck made his decision, Dems flipped the fuck out. His decision went against the wishes of Biden and the Dems to electrify the federal fleet and start meeting carbon emission reduction goals. Plenty of reps including Tim Ryan from Ohio are insisting this contract award be revisited and reconsidered. This isn’t a fight they’re gonna give up on. WKHS has promised to challenge this decision and I’m sure if this stands many eco hippies are gonna lose their shit. What sounds impossible in reversing it isn’t that much of an impossibility at all. Enough about this contract though. \\n\\nLike I said in my previous DD, this company is so much more than this shitty government’s potential post office truck. They have potential suitors in IKEA, who are currently testing a fleet and aim to go all electric by 2025. They are focusing on researching and developing refrigerated vehicles. Once companies like Walmart and other similar companies start to look for electric grocery delivery vehicles, if WKHS captures this market its a big boost not only to the companies bottom line but to shareholders as well. \\n\\nTheir horsefly drone is the real tech of the company though. Currently being tested by the UPS and patents pending for vehicle launched delivery drones, this is where I see the real growth and future of the company and I believe Mama Cathie sees as well. She doesn’t own over $45m worth of shares betting on a fucking contract, especially a government one. If they perfect this system, allowing for efficient and safe package delivery, and can manage a whole fleet with one single easy to use app they’re gonna boom. \\n\\nInstitutions continue to BTFD and the company is up to 54% institutional ownership including big boys like Blackrock, Vanguard, Citi, ARK. There’s growth here, whales see it, and whales are buying it all the fucking time. \\n\\nThey missed on revenue yesterday but that’s expected when 30% of their workforce was out with Covid for a time. Their EPS beat by a surprise $2,678% so...\\n\\nLastly, this company is a perfect candidate for a buyout and there’s chatter of a TSLA scoop up of WKHS. The EV world is increasingly becoming saturated with companies and they can’t all survive. Smaller ones can easily be bought by the big boys to try and ease this saturation and compete with one another. \\n\\nIt’s found it’s floor IMO and the only way is up from here IMO but I’m a degenerate who thought the government could do something right for once. This company is poised for a strong reversal for many reasons and I’ve been following it for over a year. \\n\\nThis isn’t financial advice I just love the damn stock.

These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC) — make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.\\nWhy is This Important? This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it touches the majority of Americans.\\nThe participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to “market forces” when they are often market manipulations.\\nThe stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. Over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers.\\nIt is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed — the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.\\nA Glossary of Illogical Terms — The securities industry has its own jargon, laws and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and, while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to.\\nBroker Dealer or Prime Broker — The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house — also known as a broker's broker.\\nHedge Funds — Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.\\nMarket Maker — A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who makes a market in a stock. In order to be a market maker, they must always have shares available to buy and sell. Market makers get certain sweeping exemptions from SEC rules involving naked shorting.\\nShort Seller — An individual, hedge fund, broker or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as “the shorts.”\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission — The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top–level management is a five–person Board of Governors who are Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse.\\nDepository Trust Clearing Corp — Usually known as the DTCC, this privately held company is owned by the prime brokers and it clears, transacts and holds most stock in this country. It has four subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS. The operation of this company is described in detail later.\\nShort Sale — Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit while the stock price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”, which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and investor L has his share back.\\nThis relatively simple process is perfectly legal – so far. The investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level. If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.\\nDisclosed Short — When the share has been borrowed or a suitable share has been located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed short. Shorts are either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some disclosed shorts are really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock borrowing.\\nNaked Short — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.\\nReturning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.\\nFails–to–Deliver — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.\\nMarket makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).\\nOptions — The stock market also has separate, but related markets that sell options to purchase shares (a “call”) and options to sell shares (a “put”). This report is only going to deal with calls; they are an integral part of short manipulations. A call works as follows: Assume investor L has a share in his account that is worth $25. He may sell an option to purchase that share to a third party. That option will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a specific future date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this option. If at the expiration date, the market value of the stock is below $30 (the “strike price”), the option expires as worthless and investor L keeps the option payment. This is called “out of the money.” If the market value of the stock is above the strike price, then the buyer of the option “calls” the stock. Assume the stock has risen to $40. The option buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of the share, which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit.\\nNaked call — The same as above except that investor L, who sells the call, has no shares in his account. In other words, he is selling an option on something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails–to–deliver list.\\n\\nHow The System Transacts Stocks — This explanation has been greatly simplified in the interest of brevity.\\n\\nCustomers — These can be individuals, institutions, hedge funds and prime broker's house accounts.\\nPrime Brokers — They both transact and clear stocks for their customers. Examples of prime brokers include Goldman Sachs; Merrill Lynch; Citigroup; Morgan Stanley; Bear Stearns, etc.\\nThe DTCC — This is the holding company that owns four companies that clear and keep track of all stock transactions. This is where brokerage accounts are actually lodged. The DTC division clears over a billion shares daily. The DTCC is owned by the prime brokers, and, as a closely held private enterprise, it is impenetrable. It actively and aggressively fights all efforts to obtain information regarding naked shorting, with or without a subpoena.\\n\\nStocks clear as follows:\\nIf customer A–1 purchases ten shares of XYZ Corp and Customer A–2 sells ten shares, then the shares are transferred electronically, all within prime broker A. Record of the transaction is sent to the DTC. Likewise, if Investor A–1 shorts ten shares of XYZ Corp and Investor A–2 has ten shares in a margin account, prime broker A borrows the shares from account A–2 and for a fee lends them to A–1.\\nIf Customer A–1 sells shares to Customer B–2, in order to get the shares to B–2 and the money to A–1, the transaction gets completed in the DTC. The same occurs for shares that are borrowed on a short sale between prime brokers.\\nAs a practical matter, what happens is prime broker A, at the end of the day, totals all of his shares of XYZ owned and all of the XYZ shares bought and sold, and clears the difference through the DTC. In theory, at the end of each day when all of the prime brokers have put their net positions in XYZ stock through the system, they should all cancel out and the number of shares in the DTC should equal the number of shares that XYZ has sold into the market. This almost never happens, because of the DTC stock borrow program which is discussed later.\\n\\nWho are the Participants in the Fraud? The participants subscribe to the theory that it is much easier to make money tearing companies down than making money building them up, and they fall into two general categories: 1) They participate in the process of producing the counterfeit shares that are the currency of the fraud and/or 2) they actively short and tear companies down.\\nThe counterfeiting of shares is done by participating prime brokers or the DTC, which is owned by the prime brokers. A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants, including Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch; UBS; Morgan Stanley and others. The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting.\\n\\nThe identity of the shorts is somewhat elusive as the shorts obscure their true identity by hiding behind the prime brokers and/or hiding behind layers of offshore domiciled shell corporations. Frequently the money is laundered through banks in a number of tax haven countries before it finally reaches its ultimate beneficiary in New York, New Jersey, San Francisco, etc. Some of the hedge fund managers who are notorious shorters, such as David Rocker and Marc Cohodes, are very public about their shorting, although they frequently utilize offshore holding companies to avoid taxes and scrutiny.\\nMost of the prime brokers have multiple offshore subsidiaries or captive companies that actively participate in shorting. The prime brokers also front the shorting of some pretty notorious investors. According to court documents or sworn testimony, if one follows one of the short money trails at Solomon, Smith Barney, it leads to an account owned by the Gambino crime family in New York. A similar exercise with other prime brokers, who cannot be named at this time, leads to the Russian mafia, the Cali drug cartel, other New York crime families and the Hell's Angels.\\nOne short hedge fund that was particularly destructive was a shell company domiciled in Bermuda. Subpoenas revealed the Bermuda company was wholly owned by another shell company that was domiciled in another tax haven country. This process was five layers deep, and at the end of the subterfuge was a very well known American insurance company that cannot be disclosed because of court–ordered sealing of testimony.\\nMost of the large securities firms, insurance companies and multi–national companies have layers of offshore captives that avoid taxes, engage in activities that the company would not want to be publicly associated with, like stock manipulation; avoid U.S. regulatory and legal scrutiny; and become the closet for deals gone sour, like Enron.\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwhj8t/read_read_read_before_they_take_the_website/') \n",

I trusted them with my literal life savings and no primary source of income....and no stimulus on the way to us middle shlubs class either. I hope you find it useful, and I hope this site isn\\'t strictly for GME because I doubt that was the intent. I hold positions in both companies. Held RKT since $20 on IPO then got railed but shorts for the next 8 months while they had their loser bottom level traders sell covered calls.  I went through weeks of depression watching this stock be fomented for nearly a year. Thank god WSB taught me what fomented meant. \\n\\nIs RKT a distraction from GME? Maybe - who knows. I don\\'t care it went up 70% and wsb gave me the courage to stay with it.  I have no idea what to believe on the reddit site anymore because HFs are spending more time diluting wsb DD rather than making good investments. Real quick tangent on that. Like who the fuck shorts 144% of a stock at $2 (GME). Who the fuck shorts RKT, a 30 year successful company who made nearly 1/2 trillion dollars in revenue in 1 year? I digress. I guess were all retards in the end. I mean how stupid do you have to be to short RKT? Like as a true millionaire/billionaire investor, that retail investor used to look up to prior to GME: how fucking stupid can you be? Did you not research anything and just said fuck it, let\\'s short the stock? You might want to start reading some more DD here and get back to the basics for a little bit. Like the CEO LITTERALLY TOLD YOU NOT TO FUCKING SHORT IT you greedy fucks.\\n\\nThis is more about RKT than GME because you should get it by now, fucking hold it until it squeezes again and buy the dip. It\\'s above $100 for a reason. It\\'s because we all like the stock. \\n\\nI worked for 4 different mortgage companies, Rocket (Quicken Loans) being one of them, and they still hold a place in my heart. If I stayed there I would probably have hella option incentives as an Executive Banker retention bonus because they are that good to their employees. Today I made a fuck ton of cash and still hold over 50k in my position - it\\'s an easy stock to hold...it\\'s a good company, and finally word is getting out about it after watching shorts kept it sideways since fucking 09/2020. Just more tendies to buy more GME.\\n\\nI quit my job selling mortgages. I didn\\'t quit RKT (Quicken) to trade, I quit RKT because I was moving up quick and didn\\'t want to get stuck being a phone salesman my whole life. I did work there and will provide some NON-inside information that should give you further confidence on this spectacular stock.\\n\\nFirst, I am not the guy who posted that great DD about working for Rocket, but he made me want to post this. I cant find his fucking post or I would post link. I did used to work for them. I used to sell mortgages like a madman and made 300k in 2020 at 3 different job transitions then yolo\\'d my life into the stock market..lossed 10k on GME I still hold then I made 200k in the past 2 weeks on GME and RKT. This was possible because there is actually good fucking DD on here when it\\'s not infested with shrills. I literally quit my job because I believed in WSB -- pretty retarded, but it worked out so far and I am having a blast. Please don\\'t do it, this is not investment advice I just retail traded for a year and a half and know enough to educate myself further. Also, have a very high tolerance for losing money - you should not. \\n\\nI bought RKT at $20 a share on IPO, saw it run to 34, then lost all my gains plus some over the next 2 weeks by shorts. I had no clue that is what happened because at that time I still thought Webull News articles were a good source of information. THANK YOU GME for educating me. \\n\\n**Why you should buy RKT calls/shares?**\\n\\n1) It\\'s a safe stock still relatively\\n\\nTo be entirely honest, I would trust my life with Quicken Loans (RKT) even though I don\\'t work there anymore. Their executives truly do the right thing. If you think they are going to let this stock go back to $20, then you\\'re out of your stupid ass mind and you shouldn\\'t be here. \\n\\n2) They knew today was going to happen\\n\\nIt\\'s a bigger company than the Ticker RKT. They have very talented smart individuals in the finance world and been doing it for 30 years. O yeah, and a fuck ton of money/resources. To quote Jay baby - \"This isn\\'t a stock you want to be short.\" They literally predict rates with their technology...and they have better tech than most hf. They have a whole capital markets department, and they also own Benzinga, a market news company. To simply put it...it\\'s not a company who doesn\\'t know how to handle short sellers. HFs didn\\'t listen Jay and Dan G made them his bitch today. I know Dan\\'s personality - he would literally have called me directly and fired me on the spot if he found out I didn\\'t return a customer call within 24 hours...that\\'s his biggest priority. I\\'m not being hyperbolic, he would have literally called me personally. That\\'s an owner you want when you invest, an owner who can handle hedge fund pussies. You don\\'t want to be on his bad side because he loves his company and his employees like his children.  \\n\\nYou don\\'t get companies like this everyday. With this type of power, resources, and intelligence, I don\\'t see how they wouldn\\'t be in the s&amp;p 500 in 3 - 5 years. \\n\\n3) They wont fail unless Dan ceases to exist \\n\\nIt\\'s the Quicken way (RKT). They take care of their employees, I cant stress this enough. They work you to death, but that W2 and that free $800 watch gift just because it\\'s Monday is all worth it. Especially since you dont even need a college degree to work there, but they treat you as if you make a million a year. They are the literal tits. They train you they way they want you to work...doesn\\'t matter where you come from. Also, your directors (managers), and highly trained and end up being a friend not a boss. They don\\'t believe in superiority. **This is good for the stock** because everyone who works at RKT thinks it\\'s normal to work 60 hours a week. Like I said, I worked for 4 different mortgage companies and got away with 200k ytd gross profits while swinging my dick in my hand. NOOOO MORTGAGE COMPANY WILL EVER BE ON THEIR LEVEL. ZEROOOOO. What they are eating for breakfast is more of a priority than the possibility of mortgage company competition. Wait until LDI just shits bricks when rates go up...i think that\\'s their biggest competition...LDI has a market cap of 7 billion compared to RKT 80 billion. LDI is a mortgage company, Rocket is...well a fucking rocket and own the Cavs because why not. \\n\\n4) The move at lightning speed and eventually the world will know it as the norm for them.\\n\\nIf they want to innovate, they innovate. If they want to acquire new companies with the additional 40 billion in market cap they just received today, they will acquire new companies. They are obsessed with finding a better way. I don\\'t think I ever witnessed them set a goal and not achieve that goal. It\\'s Amazon innovation speed. \\n\\nPosition 20x50c 03/19, 10x20c 01/2022 and 1k shares. \\n\\nNot financial advice, I just love the fucking stock. I literally know nothing other than the fact that you probably want to own at least a bit of RKT.', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwhgl7/i_quit_my_job_because_i_like_the_stock_and_it_was/') \n",

RKT seemed to have flatlined this afternoon around $40. If the $36 strike was the highest available for 3/5 expiry, I think this could be part of the reason why it hit resistance in the low $40’s. \\n\\nHere’s why:\\nPeople like to buy cheap OTM options. Since the $36 strike was the highest offered strike price for this week, it got expensive for options traders to play. When the stock was $43, that $36 call was trading for upwards of $700 in premium. My guess is this put the options game out of play for a lot of traders and the stock began to lose some momentum.\\n\\nWhy this matters:\\nOn expiration date, all ITM calls have the ability to be exercised, and 100 shares per option owned need to be available for purchase. This generally drives the stock price up, and in turn puts pressure on short sellers to cover. Additionally, the $1.11 dividend will have to be paid by the short sellers if they are still short this Friday.\\n\\nTL/DR;\\nIf higher strike 3/5 calls are added, RKT 🚀🚀🚀 even more.\\n\\nPosition: 300 shares, 12 deep ITM calls ($10-15 2023)\\n\\n**I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

WallStreetBets is about making money, doesn't matter what play. And yes, there will be some bagholders on that one. But everyone playing it knows the risk. There's only two appropriate responses if someone tells you the bought into $RKT. 1)If they lose money, you troll them and call them a retard. 2)They make money, and you congratulate them and tell them to fuck themselves.\\n\\nNow, none of you are wrong to be skeptical about the play. It does in fact seem too easy, doesn't it? Well, as noted in the below post, at LEAST two of the hedge funds we're fighting on the GME front are in on the $RKT play:\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the\\\\_industry\\\\_players\\\\_again\\\\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the_industry_players_again_gme/)\\n\\n(Credit to u/Dadri88 and u/skifunkster)\\n\\nBut what if I told you it didn't matter that they were profiting off that play? I'm serious, it doesn't matter. Even if they personally asked the Board of Rocket to declare the special dividend, and planned to mobilize WSB in pursuit of profit (They didn't do this), we should still be lining up to kiss them. They're hanging themselves in front of our eyes? Here's why:\\n\\n$GME needs a catalyst. We've known this is still a legitimate play, but most posts are in agreement. We needs whales, we need hedge funds on our side, and we need catalysts. We now have SEVERAL catalysts. In case you've forgotten, the catalysts for GME occuring this month are: Earnings, The Quadruple Witching Day, and now $RKT.\\n\\nWhy is $RKT a catalyst for GME? We're not quite at the finish line yet. How will we know when we're close? They'll pull out our controllers again (Limiting Buying). How do they wind up defeated if they do this? Big money on our side. $RKT will get us that money. If you're still too retarded to picture it, let me provide an example.\\n\\nImagine you're Papa Elon. You want to shoot your SpaceX Rockets to the Moon and beyond. So far, you've loaded the ships with apes and bananas, but you need some ACTUAL astronauts on board. How do you earn the trust of the real astronauts (AKA BIG MONEY)? You launch a test flight. $RKT is the SpaceX test flight, retards. It doesn't matter if you like the play, if you're in on the action, or not. You SHOULD be cheering it on.\\n\\nIf it works, we have proof of concept. Imagine it: A Massive short squeeze on a company where the short interest is only 30-40%. What do you think will prove our point that squeezes can be squoze, better than seeing a real live squeeze in public view? It's literally the best thing that could happen.\\n\\nSo, moral of the story: Sit back, shut the fuck up, and cheer those other retards on! If that play works, it will help send our own to the goddamn moon!

This is not a company that only the older generation/younger generation can connect with. We all have had some kind of experience in movie theaters and most likely have run into an AMC at some point in our lives. \\n\\nNow over the past few years AMC has begun to drop in stock value \\\\[steadily\\\\]. Most of the drops is due to poor money management and over expansion, recently however it was due to Covid-19's forced closures and streaming services taking over.\\n\\nEarly last year, AMC bought more cinemas in Europe \\\\[now AMC has the **most theaters** of all companies\\\\] but instead of bringing it more revenue it gave AMC a blow due to the costs of property purchase and closures due to Covid and cutting of revenue. This has caused AMC to be a prime target for short sale attacks last year dropping the price significantly and at one point hitting **1.91$** which is an all time low. \\n\\nSo to sum up why it was low last year.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* Streaming services being used more\\n* Cinemas closed due to Covid.\\n* No vaccine in sight \\\\[uncertainty for its future\\\\]\\n* Bankruptcy possibility\\n* Free reign hedge fund short selling \\n* No one buying the stock\\n\\n# Now this year is different\\n\\nWe all know what happens here. I wont go in and explain this to heavily, GME hype led to retail investors investing in other heavily shorted companies and AMC being one of them. AMC sold off shares to retain funds and rule out bankruptcy for the next 4 years.\\n\\n# Overvalued or Undervalued?\\n\\nFor the most part, the media has been completely bearish on AMC. The price many media outlets tossed out for AMC has been 1-3$. Now let me explain why I believe that number is completely idiotic.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* ~~Streaming services being used more~~ This may be true for the most part, at the minimum pent up demand will have people skipping Netflix night and going out with friends to the cinema. It has already began with people renting out cinemas for person use. If people are willing to pay 100$+ to rent out a cinema for their family, I doubt they wouldn't be willing to go and watch the next blockbuster hit with a crowded reactionary theater.\\n* ~~Cinemas closed due to Covid.~~ New York announced 25% capacity theaters come early March. This alone made the stock shoot up. Imagine a 50%-75% or complete re-opening of AMC theaters? Cinemas are being open soon so this should be another reason to drive up bullishness.\\n* ~~No vaccine in sight \\\\[uncertainty for its future\\\\]~~ Multiple vaccines have been approved by FDA. Recently Johnson &amp; Johnsons single dose vaccine. Dr Fauci has told reporters recently that vaccines will be made available to **all Americans** by April of this year.\\n* ~~Bankruptcy possibility~~ Completely ruled out for the next 4 years due to funds acquired during January rise in prices and stocks being sold off.\\n* ~~Free reign hedge fund short selling~~  Unlike last year, this year AMC is the most held stock on Robinhood and Webull. For a hedge fund to bet against AMC when it is the most held stock imo is just moronic. Hedge funds had free reign last year with no one holding it and could barely get AMC to drop to 1.91$ before it began to rise past 2$ again. Now that it is one of the most \\\\[if not most\\\\] held stock in existence right now, I could not see a legitimate reason to short the stock or at minimum expect it to be valued at below 5$ which many media outlets have been doing.\\n* ~~No one buying the stock~~  Not only are people buying it, they are also holding it. All of AMCs rivals are smaller companies with little to no retail investor interest compared to AMC. They are all above 20$, how AMC is not valued at 10$ minimum by analysis completely proves my point that this stock is just being forced low and is only being held back no by hedge funds.\\n\\nNow I understand hedge funds who shorted AMC last year had valid reasons. I am not disagreeing here but what they failed to do is adapt to a change in stock market culture. A 2$ stock could be worth 1,000s of dollars if enough people believe it to be that much. Tesla stock right now has higher value  then every single auto-maker stock in existence combined. If enough people hold a stock, the stock wont fail and hedge funds should have closed their positions on AMC a long time ago.\\n\\n# Now Lets Talk About March\\n\\n[\\\\[ironically except last year due to Covid closures lol\\\\]](https://preview.redd.it/na1tpsauepk61.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fe18aa7de5242b29f9393bc332d6c58b8d24f56)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* March in general has always been a good month for AMC. If you noticed that many of the peaks began in mid March, in some instances a continued rise with new blockbusters being released in the summer time. The best thing you can get from this chart is understanding that winter is bad but March and beyond is good.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* Another reason pointing to a possible spike in price is Vanguard purchasing more shares, Wanda Group still 50% ownership of shares\\n\\n[Wanda Group converts stock in order to sell, preparing for a rise in price to sell off?](https://preview.redd.it/0fuvle80gpk61.png?width=1048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d1e6f32c67b9ef97febcb47764085f8744c6d33)\\n\\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html) \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# March 5th-11th? Yeah. I believe so.\\n\\nA lot of people come up with dates and when the date fails expectations drop and people get annoyed when nothing happens. This one is different. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* March 5th \\\\[this Friday\\\\] theaters will reopen in NY \\\\[ over 25% of AMC revenue comes from NY and California\\\\]. The volume of people entering AMC theaters Friday-Tuesday could drive prices up leading to Thursday, especially with posts on social media showing packed theaters.\\n\\n[https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* March 9th short interest report will be released. In my opinion the stock had been shorted all of February but that is just my opinion. We will see come next Tuesday but if AMC is heavily shorted \\\\[my belief it is\\\\] this will drive the price up farther.\\n\\n*Processing img ecj12fvpjpk61...*\\n\\n* AMC earning are confirmed to be released on **March 10th AFTER HOURS.**\\n\\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html)\\n\\nNot only are they confirmed to be March 10th but they are expected to **beat expectations**\\n\\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4)\\n\\n*Speculative but: Not only are they expected to beat expectations but earnings tend to be followed up with good news. I am speculating about the Amazon buy but it is entirely possible AMC would come up with some thing for its investors to bring its value up. They made a fortune in January and I see no reason for them not to try and drive the price up farther come March 10.*\\n\\n* So this leads to me believing from the re-opening this Friday \\\\[March 5th\\\\] to Short interest report \\\\[March 9th\\\\] and Earning report \\\\[March 10th after hours into 11th\\\\] we will see a large price spike in AMC. Can I be wrong? Yes. Will I be wrong? I don't know. What do I think? I like the stock and I will hold the stock. I am not telling any of you to do anything I am just sharing information and my thoughts.\\n\\n# My positions\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Processing img ei5kbec8lpk61...*\\n\\n*Processing img 8xn45ngbnpk61...*\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwh4b3/amc_prediction_march_5march_11_huge_gains/') \n",

WIN.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.\\n\\n🚨🚨MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS 🚨🚨, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. 🚨🚨\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.\\n\\n\\\\[LINK 2\\\\]\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNotice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the 💎👐 , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this 🚀. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.\\n\\nIn my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin &amp; CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.\\n\\nMORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?\\n\\n🚨🚨MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 🚨🚨\\n\\nLet's go through the numbers.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRKT's projected EPS for this year is \\\\~ $2.45. \\n\\n\\\\[LINK 3\\\\] \\\\~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \\\\~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.\\n\\nThus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.\\n\\nTherefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?\\n\\nYou know what that means?\\n\\nIT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRemember, 🚀 fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.\\n\\nI LIKE THE STOCK.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy PT is $73.5. NO \\U0001f9fb👐\\n\\nNot financial advice. I don't know anything.\\n\\nPositions: 150 shares, 50 $23 C 3/5 EXP. I will be exercising almost all my calls as I am LONG.\\n\\nI will be purchasing OTM calls tomorrow at open 🚀🚀\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwgzjs/why_its_not_over_for_rkt_more_shorts_have/') \n",

For many of us, this will most likely be the most money we have ever had, which is fantastic. I for one can\\'t wait to see this massive wealth transfer happen.\\n\\nObligatory \"I am not a financial advisor, this is based on my own experience, knowledge etc\". I work with cash rich investors and find them property investment opportunities so I have HAD to learn about money and investments.\\n\\nI would caution everyone here a few things when you have your dragon\\'s hoard of tendies:\\n\\n* **Take a deep breath.**\\n\\nAnd resist the immediate urges that come with the notion of having a lot of money. Now read the rest of this post you smooth-brained ape.\\n\\n* **Remember you might have to pay tax on this money.**\\n\\nChances are, you will have to pay tax on your earnings. MAKE SURE YOU PUT ASIDE MONEY FOR THIS. And speak to an accountant if you are unsure about any of this.\\n\\n* **Don\\'t tell anyone that doesn\\'t need to know.**\\n\\nSome people changes when it comes to money. The more people you tell, the more random friends you haven\\'t talked to in years will come your way. Hell, even family members might come to you and start asking for monetary favours and chances are you will start running relationships into the ground because of it. DO NOT TELL ANYONE THAT DOESN\\'T NEED TO KNOW.\\n\\n* **Put money aside as saving to tide you over for 3-6 months.**\\n\\nI don\\'t care that you have a shit-ton of money. What are your living costs? Now make sure you have 3-6 months of that stashed for rainy days (hopefully we won\\'t have any of those).\\n\\n* **Re-invest most of your money.**\\n\\nSeriously. Don\\'t withdraw all of it and for fuck\\'s sake do not let all that money sit in a bank. They are currently considering negative interest rates here in the UK, and currently interest rates sit at about 0.01% FUCK ALL. Re-invest it! There are a shit-zillion ways you can do that and I guarantee you all of them will be better than sticking it all in a bank account. I love property! 10-15% returns in the UK, easy peasy. Maybe that\\'s your thing, maybe it isn\\'t.\\n\\nAlso consider this, if you hold a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA, you are LIMITED to only put in £20K per financial year. HOWEVER, all the GAINS you make in that account are free to use AND you don\\'t pay taxes on withdrawals. If you took it all out however you would be limited by the 20K. So maybe you re-invest it in other stocks you like?\\n\\nMaybe you stick it in a Lifetime-savers account where you benefit from compound interest (if you don\\'t know how powerful this is, look it up!) You could be a millionaire in 30 years by just putting in a couple of thousand every year.\\n\\n* **Do not upgrade your lifestyle (too much).**\\n\\nOkay so you want your Lambo, I understand. We all do. We\\'ve been living off pot-noodles and crushed up paracetamol for so long now.\\n\\nDid you know that ONE THIRD of lottery winners usually declare bankruptcy within three to five years? Do you have any idea how many professional athletes go BROKE? (Spoiler, it\\'s a lot).\\n\\nWhy? Because these people have little-to-no financial education. We aren\\'t taught this stuff in school. No one is going to take you hand, you have to teach yourself this stuff.\\n\\nOne of the biggest mistakes people who aren\\'t used to money make, is to immediately buy a massive house, buy gifts for friends &amp; family, buy expensive cars, start hiring staff and so forth. See where I\\'m getting at?\\n\\nAsk yourself, do you really need all these luxury goods? Absolutely treat yourself, but understand it can be a VERY slippery slope that you might not be able to sustain. Which is why it is so important to have ASSETS (see point above). That shit will pay you back. Your Lambos and gifts for friends &amp; family, however nice, won\\'t.\\n\\n* **Treat yourself!**\\n\\nRead everything above? Good. You can treat yourself now. Otherwise, what\\'s the point? Get that Lambo, you deserve it. After all, you\\'ve got money stashed now and you\\'ve put most of it into investments that will pay you back and keep you living the sweet life of never having to work again.\\n\\nThat\\'s all for now folks.\\n\\nOnce again, this is NOT financial advice. Do your own research etc. Just be careful with them tendies.\\n\\nPeace.', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwgyws/a_word_of_caution_educate_yourself_about_money/') \n",

How the fuck do you turn $600 into $15,500?\\n\\nI've tried exercising my google-fu but I can't find a clear answer. My understanding of how these call options/contracts/black magic fuckery works is basically...\\n\\nYou front some money (the contract premium, which varies based on factors) so you can buy a bunch of stocks (100) at a lower price once it rises above a certain price.\\n\\nSo if you're eyeballing a stock at like... $10 and thinking 'I like that stock, it should see $20 easy', you buy a call option (or 10, or 100, or fuck if I know) and set the 'strike price' at 20.\\n\\nStock moons to 50, and you get to buy each at 20, netting you 30 per.\\n\\nThat makes sense to me.\\n\\nWhat DOESN'T MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE TO ME is how you turn $600 into $15,500. You still have to front the money to buy those stocks right? You can't just immediately turn around and sell them to make money magically appear without first paying for them, right?\\n\\nSo how the fuck?\\n\\nI read something about selling the contracts instead of exercising your right to buy? Is that how this happens? How does that work? Wouldn't you have to find a buyer for the contract? Or can you just turn around to the seller and say 'Lol, I can has money'? and immediately sell the contract to the seller? Or are contracts always in high demand?\\n\\nEven that makes no sense, because what's stopping someone from setting a dumb strike price of like... $12 on a $10, and then turning around and immediately selling the contract for like... $1,200 ($12 x100 = 1,200)? Is the premium high enough to dissuade that sort of bullshit?\\n\\nHelp me understand this please?\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwgmer/eli5_call_options/') \n",

This stick was a bargain around 37-38 but now it's just free money when this thing rebounds back to 45 where it was less than a month ago.\\n\\nHere are the highlights of the earnings call today in case you missed it:\\n\\n* Net sales increased by 23.1% to $806.8 million, which includes $53.3 million from the 53rd week.\\n* Comparable store sales increased by 7.9% on a 13-week basis over a 5.1% increase in the same period last year.\\n* The Company opened eight new stores ending the quarter with 380 stores in six states.\\n* Net income increased 146.8% to $24.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.\\n* Adjusted net income(1) increased 46.1% to $24.2 million, or $0.24 per non-GAAP diluted share.\\n* Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 24.7% to $51.2 million.\\n\\nThis is all good news for us and only proves that after the sell off after earnings this thing is going TO THE FUCKING MOON!🚀\\n\\nHere are some highlights from 2020 compared to 2019:\\n\\n* Net sales increased by 22.5% to $3.13 billion.\\n* Comparable store sales increased by 12.7% on a 52-week basis compared to a 5.2% increase in the comparable period last year.\\n* The Company opened 35 new stores and closed two stores during the year.\\n* Net income increased 592.1% to $106.7 million, or $1.08 per diluted share.\\n* Adjusted net income(1) increased 86.9% to $112.7 million, or $1.14 per non-GAAP diluted share.\\n* Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 32.4% to $222.9 million.\\n\\nAND if that wasn't good enough here is what things are looking like moving forward for us.The Company currently expects to open between 36 and 38 stores this year with one closure. They anticipate that comparable sales for the first quarter will decline in the negative high-single digits reflecting the impact of cycling the initial demand surge related to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Excluding the impact of discrete items, they anticipates a normalized fiscal 2021 tax rate of 28%.apital expenditures, net of tenant improvement allowances, are estimated to be approximately $130.0 million.\\n\\nThis is an extremely cyclical stock and moving into spring and summer are the biggest months for GO as cooking and overall grocery shopping increases. I can't overstate how undervalued they are right now at $34 and the calls are DIRT CHEAP.\\n\\nPositions or GFTO:\\n\\n3/19 40$ Calls - 35\\n\\n4/16 40$ calls - 50\\n\\n6/16 40$ calls - 50\\n\\nI know march 19th seems soon but this thing is going to rebound very quickly with the rest of the market and they are so cheap I couldn't pass them up. WE WILL see $45 by the end of March, I am NOT financial analyst, I eat crayons with a straw, please do your own DD.\\n\\nTLDR; GO is stupid cheap right now and is going to go HARD the next couple weeks - don't miss out BUY THE FUCKING DIP!\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwggp3/who_is_ready_to_go_grocery_outlet_huge_opportunity/') \n",

Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.\\n\\nYou're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?\\n\\nI have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert &amp; Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.\\n\\n🚨🚨MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS 🚨🚨, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. 🚨🚨\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l](https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNotice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the 💎👐 , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this 🚀. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.\\n\\nIn my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin &amp; CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.\\n\\nMORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?\\n\\n🚨🚨MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 🚨🚨\\n\\nLet's go through the numbers.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRKT's projected EPS for this year is \\\\~ $2.45. (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \\\\~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.\\n\\nThus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.\\n\\nTherefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?\\n\\nYou know what that means?\\n\\nIT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRemember, 🚀 fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.\\n\\nI LIKE THE STOCK.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy PT is $73.5. NO \\U0001f9fb👐\\n\\nNot financial advice. I don't know anything.\\n\\nPositions: 150 shares, 50 $23 C 3/5 EXP.

Needless to say, much like the rest of you, I have spent hours upon hours looking at the trends, shorts, and data since the day of reckoning last month. \\n\\n**And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread** (especially with RKT)\\n\\n**To simply put it,** in my opinion, **we are on the verge of something big**... \\n\\n**TL:DR at the bottom for the most atuist**\\n\\nHere is why my fellow tards,\\n\\n1) **We have proven the community strength**, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some **green** for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote \"**Lackluster day**\" we are still up **162.5%** the past WEEK!\\n\\n2) **A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???** Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but **it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.** Don\\'t take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other **\"GAMMA SQUEEZE\" for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.** \\n\\n3) The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know **that they have lost billions.** Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high. \\n\\nSOURCE: Wall Street Journal, 5 days ago. \\n\\n*Processing img v59kaj2xapk61...*\\n\\n**Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.** I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, **how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can\\'t- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)** \\n\\n4) **With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.** Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. **But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.** In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze. \\n\\n[F ROBINHOOD](https://preview.redd.it/w55we4o6dpk61.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e211a49e42220b19f3998f6c764a4dbd428c5bb0)\\n\\n5) **I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold.

There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a \"NEW SQUEEZE RKT\" (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding.

People will want to take a smaller loan out, and use more cash, because inflation creates spending and high interest rates deter people from collecting debt. Housing prices are in a bubble right now due to low rates. That bubble will pop when rates rise. Rates will rise, inflation will rise, cash spending will rise, debt will lower, houses will sell cheaper. REITs will continue to yield great earnings and totally recover; big tendies.   \\n\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMITT- [Pre-Covid=$16 Now=$4.4 (5.85% Short)](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/summary?fromPage=overview&amp;display=&amp;fromSearch=true&amp;symbol=MITT)   \\nIVR- [Pre-Covid= $18, Now=$4 (short 11.8%)](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/summary?fromPage=overview&amp;display=&amp;fromSearch=true&amp;symbol=IVR)\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\"I don’t follow that logic, I think higher rates with inflation will cause a net no change to house prices\"\\n\\n \\\\-You don\\'t think higher rates affect housing cost? \\n\\n \"Yes, higher rates usually drop home prices but wouldn’t inflation pick it back up?\" \\n\\n\\\\-Inflation isn\\'t considered *in the moment* the way rates are. Inflation takes 3months to two years for change to occur. When you get a quote for an interest rate, at max it\\'ll last 3 months before you gotta pull a trigger\\n\\n\\\\-As inflation rises, people will have more cash to spend, which leads to more cash up front for down payment. Usually, a higher down payment = negotiation of lower house price.  \\n\\\\-So, people will have both, more cash for down payment and a higher interest on a loan = perfect leverage for a lower price, this means a higher execution of sales... \\n\\n \"Wouldn’t that create higher demand?\" \\n\\n\\\\-Demand is high right now, highest it has ever been. But, that doesn\\'t lead to execution if the buyer isn\\'t comfortable with the price. A lot of deals that have gone on this year failed to execute. This is usually because a homeowner sends in the inspector and lists some things to knock price down (which is typical) and the homeowner doesn\\'t budge because they were only ever interested in selling for the ridiculously high prices other homes are selling for. House doesn\\'t sell and homeowner ends up waiting for a better time in the market than in the middle of winter (when rates were lowest and demand was still growing)\\n\\n\\\\-Lower rates create higher demand. Demand is super high right now, another reason prices are ballooned too much. Demand cant get higher than where it is, so I believe it will go down when people get rates twice what they were 3 months prior. \\n\\n\\\\-My point being, the price will come down when it gets to brass and taxes. Houses will sell and people will be there to buy. REITs will still pull hefty profits and will recover.  \\n\\n\\nI am not an FA, I\\'m either rainman or just retarded; what you think?', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwfyks/thoughts_on_mitt_ivr_other_reits/') \n",

Farming these days isn’t just about throwing some seeds into the ground and hoping for the best, its about Precision farming. \\n\\nThere’s 3 main aspects of precision farming that’s relevant to drones;\\n\\n* · mapping/data\\n* · general spraying (think whole fields) \\n* · spot spraying (targeting ie weed patch in the middle of a field)\\n\\nBut im going to be more talking about why companies regarding general spraying are worth taking a look at while there relatively cheap. This is coming from the perspective of a farmer and is the general view in the UK agriculture community.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Breaking down spraying operating**\\n\\nSo its important to know the current costs of conventual vs drone spraying. With the FFA (USA) and the CAA (not fully rolled out but is slowly) (UK) allowing and starting to promote the use of drones for spraying its something that over the coming years will be a natural progression for farmers.\\n\\nThe applicants/ferts are NOT taken into account as they will be the same though out the board and vary from crop and location.\\n\\nWhat this table shows. Breaks down 3 options \\n\\n* 1. DJI AGRA T20 (yes I know I know not a publicly traded company but is good for a case study)\\n* 2. A used sprayer  \\n* 3. A brand new John deere sprayer.\\n\\nThe fixed parameters that are relevant are;\\n\\n* · Fuel £0.50/L\\n* · Labour £8\\n* · Drone hours halved (assumed they’ll be working on a pre mapped basis may even be less hours)\\n\\n(apologies you'll have to zoom)\\n\\n*Processing img gxn12sic8pk61...*\\n\\nSo to break this down for a 900Ha (2223 acre) farm yearly the difference between even a used sprayer and a DJI drone is £10,842 alone which is pretty much a return on the initial purchase in a year…. \\n\\nNow for a farmer that’s a lot, and if they can save that much money on operating alone then it’s a natural progression and choice, especially with the lower cost a lot of famers have the view of “its worth a go” \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Overall view of 98%ish farmers I’ve spoken to**\\n\\n* · Less/cheaper to maintain.\\n* · Relatedly disposable (cost- drone vs sprayer)\\n* · Manage multiple from an office (fleet operations/contracting) etc \\n* · Solar panels are becoming cheaper so almost no running cost\\n* · More versatile, can be used for crop monitoring/data collection (so don’t need to leave the office!)\\n* · More effective work rate then humans\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Companies I think are showing potential** \\n\\n· **Actual drone manufactures**\\n\\n* o $DFLY - Draganfly inc\\n* o $UAVS – AgEagle Arial systems \\n* o $AVAV – AreoViroment inc\\n\\n· **Component parts** \\n\\n* o $AMBA – Ambarella (yes I know they’ve had there ups and downs)\\n* o $TRMB – Trimble (not only in drone mapping but also becoming more used in conventional precision Ag)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nLike I said not DD or technical analysis, but I think a lot of you who are maybe thinking about automation and are into longer term plays may have been interested in hearing from a farmers perspective but also the cost of operation drones VS conventional fleets.\\n\\nOverall drones more so on the spraying basis have a humongous potential, from an operating cost perspective alone it allows a more streamlined and cheaper operation. With the cost of the equipment alone even DJI’s drone at 10k roughly which is deemed as the premium of the market is penny’s in the world of agriculture equipment. Yes they have smaller capacity but with a higher work rate, cheaper operation its by the by. \\n\\nIf there are another people interested I can go into a more technical analysis of this all but unsure of how many people are interested in Agriculture here. \\n\\n**TLDR**  \\n Agriculture spraying drones have a potential massive upside and future in the market based of the operating/purchase costs alone. Most farmers atlest In the UK are keen to transition from conventional spraying equipment to drones for a multitude of reasons. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis is not financial advice in the slightest, Just sharing my personal views on the potential of drones in the agriculture sector.\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwfjpq/aerial_drones_in_agriculture/') \n",

Don't FOMO on the way back down to earth. Great news, theres another one on the tarmac ready for liftoff. It's name is $UWMC. $UWMC got a little bit of traction a month or so ago leading up to its earnings report after a massive SPAC deal. Guess what? It absolutely crushed its earnings. UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively.  This company is just getting started and has massive opportunity for growth. It was trading around $11 and got as high as $12 leading up to the earnings report? What happened after they released news that they absolutely crushed it? The stock plummeted, and it kept plummeting. It had maybe 4 green days out of 30 in the month after its earnings report. Why? Shorts. Who do we hate? The shorts! \\n\\nAdditionally, its a great income stock! UWMC declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021. Do you like free money? Load up on this bad boy prior to March 10th! \\n\\nThere are plenty of other catalysts and reasons to long this. It is getting added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 index by the end of this month, and it will absolutely crush its earnings again this quarter. Tomorrow, contracts will be pretty expensive as IV will go thru the roof in the AM, but as of market close there were still very reasonable prices for March, April, and May (post earnings) calls.  \\n\\nLook at this activity aftermarket, it is up $1.30 (\\\\~15%)!

Enjoy!\\n\\nThese are some gems of wisdom from the greatest trader that ever lived. Jesse Livermore.

He started trading in his teens in [bucketshops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_shop_(stock_market)) in his home state of Massachusetts. After making 10\\'s of thousands, he moved to NYC and worked his way up to several million.\\n\\nAt his peak, he had yachts, several luxury properties all over Manhattan and a yellow Rolls Royce that never had to stop at intersections because he paid off cops to turn the signals green when they saw him coming.\\n\\nThis guy made and lost 10s of millions several times until he lost almost all off it in the 1920s. He then made a bet against the market right before the 1929 crash and made $100 million which is the equivalent of $1.5B in todays money, earning him the nickname \"The Great Bear.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note his old saying *\"There is no bull side or bear side, there is only the right side.\"*\\n\\nEventually towards the end of his life he once again lost most of his money and went long $ROPE by shooting himself in an NYC hotel.\\n\\nRegardless of his tragic ending. The guy amassed several lifetimes of wealth from nothing more than a handful of times and the book [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://www.amazon.com/Reminiscences-Operator-Investment-Strategies-Livermore/dp/B08L3XC9FV/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=3R2TJ52J7E5FW&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=reminiscences+of+a+stock+operator&amp;qid=1614723417&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=remi%2Cstripbooks%2C165&amp;sr=1-2-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzT0hISUgyMzdVUDY2JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDc1MjY2WVIxTTVRNzhXTVpSJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyNTMzNDIxMlNBWlZKRUtUQlU2JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) has influenced legends like Paul Tudor Jones, Ed Seykota, Edward Thorpe and George Soros, who all site Jesse Livermore as one of their biggest influences.\\n\\nSo without further ado, here are Jesse Livermore\\'s 10 Crack Commandments for trading in stonks curated by me, a retard.\\n\\n**1. “There is nothing new in Wall Street. There can’t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again.”**\\n\\nThe market has always moved and continues to move based on human psychology and  behavior. You\\'re kidding yourself if you think otherwise.\\n\\n“The principles of successful stock speculation are based on the supposition that people will continue in the future to make the mistakes that they have made in the past.”\\n\\n**2. “Buy stocks in a bull market. Sell stocks in a bear market.”**\\n\\nDon\\'t be a 🌈 🐻 in a bull market and don\\'t be a permabull in a bear market.\\n\\n\"Trade the strongest stocks in a bull market and sell the weakest in a bear market.\"\\n\\n**3. “Do not trade every day of every year.”**\\n\\n“The desire for constant action irrespective of underlying conditions is responsible for many losses in Wall Street even among the professionals, who feel that they must take home some money every day, as though they were working for regular wages.”\\n\\n**4. The speculator’s deadly enemies are: Ignorance, greed, fear and hope.**\\xa0\\n\\n\"All the statue books in the world and all the rule books on all the Exchanges of the earth cannot eliminate these from the human animal.\"\\n\\n**5. “Only enter a trade after the action of the market confirms your opinion and then enter promptly”**\\n\\nThe only indicator you need is price action. If the price action shows you that you\\'re right, make the trade. The most profitable trades usually show a profit right away. I get that there are exceptions but it\\'s never smart to rack up losses and tie up capital while you wait for the market to catch up. You can usually form an opinion and then open your position when you notice price movement in your direction.\\n\\n\"Markets are never wrong - opinions often are.\"\\n\\n**6. “Continue with trades that show you a profit, end trades that show a loss”**\\n\\n\"They say you can never go poor taking profits. No, you don’t. But neither do you grow rich taking a four-point profit in a bull market. Where I should have made twenty thousand I made two thousand. That was what my conservatism did for me.\"\\n\\n“Losing money is the least of my troubles.\\xa0 A loss never troubles me after I take it.\\xa0 I forget it overnight.\\xa0 But being wrong – not taking the loss – that is what does the damage to the pocket book and to the soul.”\\xa0\\n\\n**7. “Never average losses by, for example, buying more of a stock that has fallen”**\\n\\n\"Having bought at 50 and being concerned over a three-point loss on a hundred shares, what rhyme or reason is there in adding another hundred shares at 47 and having the worry double when the price hits 44? At that point there would be a $600 loss on the first hundred shares and a $300 loss on the second hundred shares.\"\\n\\n**8. “Big movements take time to develop”**\\n\\n\"It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting.\"\\n\\n**9. “It is much easier to watch a few than many”**\\n\\nDon\\'t watch too many stonks.\\n\\n**10.** **“A man cannot be convinced against his own convictions, but he can be talked into a state of uncertainty and indecision, which is even worse, for that means that he cannot trade with confidence and comfort.”**\\xa0\\n\\nDon\\'t trade on tips from other people and don\\'t let someone else talk you out of a trade that you have confidence in.', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwf5au/10_crack_commandments_wsb_remix/') \n",

Or Facebook?\\n\\nZynga (yes, the FarmVille one) has had a solid year. They’ve shown good profit and have a strong outlook for 2021. When they’re compared to competitors they’re undervalued by about $5 per share depending on the day. They hold solid market share, and have agreements in place for strong properties (Harry Potter and Star Wars to start). \\n\\nI’ve been reading some speculative rumors that Zynga has been having some discussions about being acquired by a larger company. I’ve seen arguments Snap has a standing agreement with Zynga for gaming, and Facebook will, at some point, need to work more on diversifying. Both want need to expand into new realms of revenue and buying a profitable company with a growing user base would be a solid move.  However, I want to throw an idea out there that Apple could have a good case to buy Zynga to bolster their own somewhat feeble (for Apple) gaming division both on mobile and on devices like the Apple TV.\\n\\nThere is apparently a new TV coming out, but at what point is that device pointless when a lot of TVs are coming with Apple software native to the TVs OS?  To me, the logical expansion is to make it a more gaming friendly console and a good way to do that is to add a suite of games by buying the dev. \\n\\nOn mobile the draw is more so to cut out the middle man and add Zynga profits to their own. Zynga also owns rights to some great properties and has a close competitor to Fortnite coming out. This would help Apple fight Fortnite its self and the messy battle that that is turning into.\\n\\n\\n\\nI put some money on ZNGA for these reasons.

I’m just expressing myself...\\n\\nWith that being said, I honestly don’t think that RKT is a shill tactic. RKT is probably a short squeeze separate to the GME and AMC squeezes. Is it distracting, it sure as hell is. Me personally, I think a squeeze is happening as we speak and so maybe it’s worth investing in, maybe not.\\n\\nI personally do not have a position in RKT and I won’t go into it because I have my cash invested into GME (as well as my other blue chips). I’m still -45% but I very strongly believe that we are gonna see this squeeze come into play some time around 15th March - 19th March. This would be due to: the second GME hearing 17th leading to an increase in media attention, Quadruple Witching day (extreme volume trading) 19th, with GME Q4 reports coming around the 25th. If the squeeze is to happen, mostly likely it will happen around mid to end March. \\n\\nNow back to RKT, i think that with this volatility that I personally wouldn’t sell my GME shares to free up capital to invest into RKT, why would I lock in losses and then further risk being a bag holder for the RKT squeeze because the moment to invest in would’ve been 2 days ago before we saw the jump and chances are that the squeeze will be finished very soon. If you are going to invest into RKT then I suggest you deposit more cash into you account and use that instead. \\n\\nAt the end, it’s your choice. I know we all love GME and AMC but we can’t fool ourselves by calling RKT a shill. My only advice I wish you do take from this is to never get too emotional and never let seeing a stock rally make you feel greedy that you think you’ll get lucky and ride that squeeze. There’s no telling when it will end. But when it does it’ll crash back to earth. On the other hand, GME is a squeeze entirely of its own class. One that we cannot comprehend just yet. If the squeeze happens, which I believe it will. It will be historic. One that will be on movies and taught in economics classes for the future generations.\\n\\nOf course you do not have to listen to me. I don’t even know what I’m saying. But, if we all keep holding our GME shares, then we will inevitably squeeze the greatest of all squeezes.
